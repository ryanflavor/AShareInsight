### Architectural Principles
[Source: architecture/1-高阶架构-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Contract-Driven Development**: Pydantic 2.0 models as "contracts" - single source of truth for all module development
- **Repository Pattern**: Create data access layer to decouple business logic from data storage
- **Pipeline Pattern**: Organize offline data processing flow as clear, modular pipeline for debugging and extension
- **Dependency Injection Pattern**: Use in API service layer to decouple service modules and facilitate unit testing
- **Unified Log Management**: Use structured JSON logging for debugging and maintenance
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Use pytest with test cases based on shared "contract models" and pytest-mock for dependency isolation

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/9-编码标准与规范.md]
- **Code Formatting & Checking**: Black and Ruff mandatory
- **Naming Conventions**: Strict PEP 8 compliance
- **Type Hints & Models**: MUST use type hints, all data models MUST be built on Pydantic 2.0 (`from pydantic import BaseModel`)

### Critical Logging Requirements
[Source: architecture/1-高阶架构-high-level-architecture.md]
- **MANDATORY**: Implement unified structured JSON logging from the start
- **Format**: Structured JSON format for all log entries
- **Context Enrichment**: Include module, correlation IDs as per architecture requirements
- **Centralized Configuration**: Replace any scattered logging.basicConfig() calls with centralized config
- **Enterprise Compliance**: Critical for production monitoring and debugging capabilities

### File Locations and Naming Conventions
Based on project structure:
- **Data Models**: `packages/core/src/core/models.py` - All Pydantic 2.0 models
- **Database Utilities**: `packages/core/src/core/database.py` - Connection and infrastructure
- **Database Scripts**: Root level `init-db.sql` or `scripts/init-database.py`
- **Test Files**: `tests/core/test_models.py`, `tests/core/test_database.py`
- **Configuration**: `pyproject.toml` (root level), `docker-compose.yml`

### Technical Constraints and Requirements
- Database connections MUST use postgresql+psycopg:// format for langchain-postgres compatibility
- Vector operations MUST use HNSW indexing for performance optimization (target < 10ms search latency)
- All Pydantic models MUST be compatible with Pydantic 2.0+ API changes
- JSONB fields must support complex nested structures for LLM output storage
- Foreign key relationships must maintain referential integrity across all tables
- Vector dimension MUST be exactly 2560 to match Qwen Embedding model output

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/8-测试策略-testing-strategy.md]

**TDD Core Principles**:
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle: Write failing test → Write minimal code to pass → Refactor optimize
- Test-first approach: Core business logic must write tests first, then implementation
- Single responsibility: Each test only verifies one specific behavior
- Fast feedback: Unit tests execution time < 50ms, integration tests < 5s

**Test Architecture**:
- **Test Pyramid**: Large foundation of unit tests, supplemented by appropriate integration tests and small number of end-to-end tests
- **Unit Tests**: Use pytest and pytest-mock, test individual functions/classes in isolation, must mock all external dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Connect to real PostgreSQL database running in Docker, test inter-module collaboration
- **End-to-End Tests**: Use httpx library, send real API requests to complete application deployed in pre-release environment

**Vector Database Testing Standards**:
- **Performance Benchmark**: HNSW search latency < 10ms (1 million vectors)
- **Accuracy Validation**: Vector similarity search accuracy > 95%
- **Compatibility Testing**: Verify langchain-postgres + pgvector version matrix compatibility

**Test Structure for This Story**:
- **Test Location**: `tests/` directory in project root
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/core/test_models.py` for Pydantic model validation
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/core/test_database.py` for database connectivity and operations
- **Database Tests**: Use Docker-based PostgreSQL for database functionality testing
- **Mock Requirements**: Mock all external dependencies during unit testing
- **Performance Tests**: Validate HNSW index creation and performance with sample data
